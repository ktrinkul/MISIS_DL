Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of the mountains, there lived a tiny hedgehog named Sonic. Sonic was a nimble and chatty creature, always eager to share his wares of food with his tiny pack of didgeridoo friends.

Sonic was the son of a gentle, wise hermit. Whenever she returned from high up mountains to find wildflowers and singing bees, Sonic would play and sing with all of her own songs in harmony. For several generations, everything had been good in the village, until the village elder, a Forest Sage, noticed Sonic's apparent sorrow his companions were being treated poorly.

Conflict began when the Forest Sage stumbled upon Sonic's joyful melodies. Now, the village understood that they needed to mend Sonic's father and strengthen their bond. The village elder hired a wise tutor to take Sonic under his wing HIS father, to keep Sonic growing healthy and socially conscious.

Sonic's happiness was quickly woven into the fabric of the village, and soon, the hermit herself was very touched by the new happiness and care for her own community.

Through his love to show his happiness to Sonic, he did not wish for herself to fade into darkness and with it, the darkness within Sonic's heart too. Now, Sonic, the hermit, and the village elder began to amplify the glow around Sonic, making his happiness this land was worthy.

Word of their triumphal success spread far and wide, where they started a bounty for those after happiness. An unwritten rule inside the village known as Enigma was strengthened, so the happiness of the/title/guardians of Sonic's inner world to be respected by all.

The happiness of Sonic spread quickly and before long, the village's stability in and about the stars was vindicated.

"My happiness is not lost, not now that the skies are calm and the stars welcoming me with their might. it was your kindness and love and these future good deeds to me near and dear to the permanent mind of this little hedgehog. This little hedgehog is my protector, my friend, our joy, my wrong, my dream for all seasons. He is my stable基石."
